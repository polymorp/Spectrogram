# Spectrogram
**Spectrogram** is a .NET library for creating spectrograms from pre-recorded signals or live audio from the sound card.  Spectrogram uses FFT algorithms and window functions provided by the [FftSharp](https://github.com/swharden/FftSharp) project, and it targets .NET Standard 2.0 so it can be used in .NET Framework and .NET Core projects.

## Quickstart

### Install

Spectrogram can be installed with NuGet:\
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spectrogram

### Create a Spectrogram

This code in [Program.cs](src/Spectrogram.Quickstart/Program.cs) was used to create the above image:
```cs
(double[] audio, int sampleRate) = Read.MP3("cant-do-that.mp3");

var spec = new Spectrogram(
        signal: audio,
        sampleRate: sampleRate,
        fftSize: 4096,
        stepSize: 500,
        freqMax: 2500,
    );

spec.SaveJPG("output.jpg");
```

If you're using Spectrogram in a graphical application you may find it helpful to retrieve the output as a Bitmap suitable for applying to a Picturebox or similar control:

```cs
Bitmap bmp = spec.GetBitmap();
pictureBox1.Image = bmp;
```

After calculating the Spectrogram (the slow step) FFT magnitudes are stored in memory so you can rapidly recalculate pixel intensities based on new parameters:

```cs
spec.Recalculate(
        multiplier: 2.8,
        dB: true,
        cmap: new Inferno()
    );
spec.SaveJPG("output2.jpg");
```

Notice the use of custom colormaps in this example.

## Song-to-Spectrogram

This example demonstrates how to convert a MP3 file to a spectrogram image. A sample MP3 audio file in the [data folder](data) contains the audio track from Ken Barker's excellent piano performance of George Frideric Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major for harpsichord ([_The Harmonious Blacksmith_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Harmonious_Blacksmith)). This audio file is included [with permission](dev/Handel%20-%20Air%20and%20Variations.txt), and the [original video can be viewed on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mza-xqk770k).

If you [listen to the audio track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mza-xqk770k) while closely inspecting the spectrogram you can identify individual piano notes and chords, and may be surprised by the interesting patterns that emerge around trills and glissandos.
